# CPPLoginSystem

> #### About
> #### This is a simple C++ program that checks if db/username.txt and db/password.txt exists and if they do it tells you to login with the saved password, and if these files dont exists it closes the program. You can preview it by running main.exe (will only work on Linux). Feel free to use it in your projects.
